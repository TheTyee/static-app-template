Work in progress toward a simple, flexible, and easy to use static news app template for The Tyee & Tyee Solutions Society projects.

# Install requirements

This is still a work in progress, but currently I'm trying to keep it pretty simple:
* Jekyll 2.0.3 (and dependencies)

Jekyll plugins (still TBD)
* [jeyll-assets](https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets)
* [jekyll-asset_bundler](https://github.com/moshen/jekyll-asset_bundler)

There's extra stuff in here for local development with Grunt, which can be ignored for now (the same functionality is included in Jekyll for the most part)
